                <div class="paragraphs">
                    <p>Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. 
                        These shifts may be natural, such as through variations in the solar cycle. 
                        But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, 
                        primarily due to burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.</p>
                    <p>Burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket 
                        wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sun’s heat and raising temperatures.</p>

                        severe droughts, powerful tropical cyclones, and extreme heat waves. Rising sea levels 
                        are flooding coastal areas, destroying homes, precious natural spaces, and quite literally

                        <h2>Save Energy at Home</h2>
                        <p>Much of our electricity and heat are powered by coal, oil and gas. Use less energy by lowering your heating 
                            and cooling, switching to LED light bulbs and energy-efficient electric appliances, washing your laundry with 
                            cold water, or hanging things to dry instead of using a dryer.</p>

                        <h2>Walk, bike, or take public transport</h2>
                        <p>The world’s roadways are clogged with vehicles, most of them burning diesel or gasoline. Walking or riding a bike 
                            instead of driving will reduce greenhouse gas emissions -- and help your health and fitness. For longer distances, 
                            consider taking a train or bus. And carpool whenever possible.</p>

                        <h2>Eat more vegetables</h2>
                        <p>Eating more vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, and less meat and dairy, can significantly lower 
                            your environmental impact. Producing plant-based foods generally results in fewer greenhouse gas emissions and requires 
                            less energy, land, and water.</p>

                        <p>Airplanes burn large amounts of fossil fuels, producing significant greenhouse gas emissions. That makes taking fewer flights 
                            one of the fastest ways to reduce your environmental impact. When you can, meet virtually, take a train, or skip that long-distance 
                            trip altogether.</p>

                        <p>When you throw food away, you're also wasting the resources and energy that were used to grow, produce, package, and transport it. 
                            And when food rots in a landfill, it produces methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. So use what you buy and compost any leftovers.</p>

                        <p>Electronics, clothes, and other items we buy cause carbon emissions at each point in production, from the extraction of raw materials 
                            to manufacturing and transporting goods to market. To protect our climate, buy fewer things, shop second-hand, repair what you can, 
                            and recycle.</p>

                        <p>Ask your utility company if your home energy comes from oil, coal or gas. If possible, see if you can switch to renewable sources such as 
                            wind or solar. Or install solar panels on your roof to generate energy for your home.</p>

                        <p>If you plan to buy a car, consider going electric, with more and cheaper models coming on the market. Even if they still run on electricity 
                            produced from fossil fuels, electric cars help reduce air pollution and cause significantly fewer greenhouse gas emissions than gas or diesel-powered vehicles.</p>

                    change and global warming, all of us have to make actions in order to take care our home. It is also the reason 
                    why we made this website is for people to know and be aware about what’s currently happening to our home.
