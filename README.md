# Happy Earth Day!
Hello since Climate Change is getting controversial. I made a website about climate change! I used CSS Flex, Grid, Media Queries, and Positions. After this I will be learning Sass, Bootstrap 5 or Tailwind, and the proper way applying different units to other elements. I will never stop learning and I will keep moving forward. I might be inactive again in GitHub, because I whenever I'm learning I might just spent my time offline experimenting. That is all thank you.
